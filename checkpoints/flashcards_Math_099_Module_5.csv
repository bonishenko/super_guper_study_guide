"[Variation] Find the distance between points A(1, 4) and P(6, 8), and the distance between points B(-2, 3) and P(6, 8). Determine which point (A or B) is closer to P.","Solution: To find the distance between two points, we use the distance formula: d = √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²]

For distance between A(1, 4) and P(6, 8):
d(A,P) = √[(6-1)² + (8-4)²]
       = √[5² + 4²]
       = √[25 + 16]
       = √41
       ≈ 6.40

For distance between B(-2, 3) and P(6, 8):
d(B,P) = √[(6-(-2))² + (8-3)²]
       = √[8² + 5²]
       = √[64 + 25]
       = √89
       ≈ 9.43

Since d(A,P) ≈ 6.40 and d(B,P) ≈ 9.43, point A is closer to point P."

"[Variation] Find the midpoint M of the line segment connecting points C(-3, 5) and D(7, -1). Then verify that M is equidistant from both C and D by calculating the distances.","Solution: To find the midpoint of a line segment connecting two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), we use the formula:
M = ((x₁+x₂)/2, (y₁+y₂)/2)

For the midpoint of the line segment connecting C(-3, 5) and D(7, -1):
M = ((-3+7)/2, (5+(-1))/2)
M = (4/2, 4/2)
M = (2, 2)

To verify that M is equidistant from both C and D, we calculate the distances:
d(M,C) = √[(2-(-3))² + (2-5)²]
       = √[5² + (-3)²]
       = √[25 + 9]
       = √34
       ≈ 5.83

d(M,D) = √[(2-7)² + (2-(-1))²]
       = √[(-5)² + 3²]
       = √[25 + 9]
       = √34
       ≈ 5.83

Since d(M,C) = d(M,D), the midpoint M is equidistant from both C and D."

"[Variation] For the quadratic equation 3x² - 12x + 9 = 0, find the x-intercepts using the quadratic formula. Then verify your answer by factoring the equation.","Solution: For the quadratic equation 3x² - 12x + 9 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:
x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a

Where a = 3, b = -12, and c = 9

x = (12 ± √((-12)² - 4(3)(9))) / 2(3)
x = (12 ± √(144 - 108)) / 6
x = (12 ± √36) / 6
x = (12 ± 6) / 6

x₁ = (12 + 6) / 6 = 18/6 = 3
x₂ = (12 - 6) / 6 = 6/6 = 1

To verify by factoring:
3x² - 12x + 9 = 0
3(x² - 4x + 3) = 0
3(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0

Therefore, x = 3 or x = 1, which matches our answer from the quadratic formula."

"[Variation] Find the slope of the line passing through the points C(-2, 6) and D(4, -3). Then write the equation of this line in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b).","Solution: To find the slope of a line passing through two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), we use the formula:
m = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁)

For the line passing through C(-2, 6) and D(4, -3):
m = (-3 - 6) / (4 - (-2))
m = -9 / 6
m = -3/2

To find the equation in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), we substitute the slope and one of the points to find b:
y = mx + b
6 = (-3/2)(-2) + b
6 = 3 + b
b = 3

Therefore, the equation of the line in slope-intercept form is:
y = -3/2x + 3"
