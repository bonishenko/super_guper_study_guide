"[Original - Section 5.1] Which of the points A(-3, 2) or B(1, -5) is farther from the point P(2, 2)?","Solution: Let d₁ denote the distance between A(-3, 2) and P(2, 2), and let d₂ denote the distance between B(1, -5) and P(2, 2). d₁ = √[(2-(-3))² + (2-2)²] = √[5² + 0²] = √25 = 5. d₂ = √[(2-1)² + (2-(-5))²] = √[1² + 7²] = √50. Since d₁ = 5 < d₂ = √50, then B is farther than A from P."
"[Variation] Which of the points C(1, 4) or D(-2, 3) is closer to the point Q(5, 7)?","Solution: Apply the distance formula to find which point is closer to Q. For point C: d₁ = √[(5-1)² + (7-4)²] = √[4² + 3²] = √(16+9) = √25 = 5. For point D: d₂ = √[(5-(-2))² + (7-3)²] = √[7² + 4²] = √(49+16) = √65 ≈ 8.06. Since d₁ = 5 < d₂ ≈ 8.06, point C is closer to point Q."
"[Original - Section 5.1] Determine the midpoint of the line segment connecting the points A(8, -3) and B(-6, -5).","Solution: M(x, y) = ((x₁ + x₂)/2, (y₁ + y₂)/2) = ((8 + (-6))/2, (-3 + (-5))/2) = (2/2, -8/2) = (1, -4). Thus, the point (x, y) = (1, -4) is equidistant to A and B on the line segment connecting A and B."
"[Variation] Find the midpoint of the line segment connecting points P(3, 7) and Q(-5, 1).","Solution: Using the midpoint formula: M(x, y) = ((x₁ + x₂)/2, (y₁ + y₂)/2) = ((3 + (-5))/2, (7 + 1)/2) = (-2/2, 8/2) = (-1, 4). Therefore, the midpoint of the line segment connecting P(3, 7) and Q(-5, 1) is the point (-1, 4)."
"[Original - Section 5.2] (i) Determine the equation of the line with slope -3 and y-intercept 5. (ii) Find the slope and y-intercept of the line with equation -6x + 5y - 2 = 0.","Solutions: (i) m = -3 and b = 5 ∴ y = mx + b ⇒ y = -3x + 5. (ii) -6x + 5y - 2 = 0 ⇒ 5y = 6x + 2 ⇒ y = (6/5)x + (2/5). ∴ the slope of the line is m = 6/5 and the y-intercept is b = 2/5."
"[Variation] (i) Write the equation of the line with slope 2 and y-intercept -3. (ii) Determine the slope and y-intercept of the line 4x - 3y + 6 = 0.","Solutions: (i) Using the slope-intercept form y = mx + b with m = 2 and b = -3: y = 2x - 3. (ii) Rearranging 4x - 3y + 6 = 0 to solve for y: -3y = -4x - 6 ⇒ y = (4/3)x + 2. Therefore, the slope is m = 4/3 and the y-intercept is b = 2."
"[Original - Section 5.2] Compute the slope of the line passing through the points A(5, -2) and B(7, -3).","Solution: Let A(5, -2) = (x₁, y₁) and B(7, -3) = (x₂, y₂). Then the slope of the line containing points A & B is m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁) = (-3 - (-2))/(7 - 5) = (-3 + 2)/2 = -1/2."
"[Variation] Calculate the slope of the line passing through the points C(-1, 4) and D(3, 8).","Solution: Using the slope formula: m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁) = (8 - 4)/(3 - (-1)) = 4/4 = 1. Therefore, the slope of the line passing through points C(-1, 4) and D(3, 8) is 1, which means the line rises at a 45-degree angle."
