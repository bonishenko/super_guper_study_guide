2The sub-domain containing a particular value is located,
and the corresponding sub-function is used:
(i) ( 5) 1 ( 5) 1 5 6
(ii) ( 2) 1 ( 2) 1 ( 2) 1

## Question 2
Section 6.1: Example:
( ) ( ) 1Find the difference quotient  if ( ) .2f a h f a xfxhx+ − −=

## Answer 2
Solution:
Each component is found then assembled into the difference quotient.
1The function ( )  indicates that whatever is inside of the bracket will be squared, then the reciprocal is taken.2xfx−=

1Let . The graph is that of a rational function with a vertical
asymptote at 0. The set of values is restricted to the interval [0,1].

## Question 4
Section 6.2: Example:
() Using the graph of  determine the intervals where  is increasing or decreasing. 
Also, determine any local maximum points or local minimum points.f x f

## Answer 4
Solution:
()()=−
− − − 
 −  32
2
3Note that from the graph, the function is ( ) . 
2Since the values increase as the values tend from  to 0 and decrease as the values tend from 0 to , the function is increasing on  and decreasing on .
