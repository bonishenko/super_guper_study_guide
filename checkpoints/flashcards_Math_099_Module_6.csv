For each input value, we need to determine which piece of the function applies, then evaluate:

(i) g(-2): Since -2 < -1, we use the first piece: g(-2) = (-2)² + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7

(ii) g(-1): Since -1 = -1, we use the second piece: g(-1) = 2(-1) - 4 = -2 - 4 = -6

(iii) g(0): Since -1 ≤ 0 < 3, we use the second piece: g(0) = 2(0) - 4 = 0 - 4 = -4

(iv) g(3): Since 3 ≥ 3, we use the third piece: g(3) = √3 ≈ 1.732

(v) g(9): Since 9 > 3, we use the third piece: g(9) = √9 = 3"

Question: 
Find the difference quotient (f(x+h) - f(x))/h if f(x) = 3x² - 2x + 5. Then determine what this expression approaches as h approaches 0.","Solution:
To find the difference quotient, we need to calculate (f(x+h) - f(x))/h:

f(x+h) = 3(x+h)² - 2(x+h) + 5
       = 3(x² + 2xh + h²) - 2x - 2h + 5
       = 3x² + 6xh + 3h² - 2x - 2h + 5

f(x) = 3x² - 2x + 5

f(x+h) - f(x) = 3x² + 6xh + 3h² - 2x - 2h + 5 - (3x² - 2x + 5)
               = 6xh + 3h² - 2h
               = h(6x + 3h - 2)

(f(x+h) - f(x))/h = (h(6x + 3h - 2))/h
                   = 6x + 3h - 2

As h approaches 0, the difference quotient approaches:
lim(h→0) (6x + 3h - 2) = 6x - 2

This is the derivative of f(x), which is f'(x) = 6x - 2."

Sketch the graph of the piecewise function f(x) = {
  |x|, if x < 0
  sin(πx/2), if 0 ≤ x ≤ 2
  4-x, if x > 2
}
Identify any discontinuities in the function.","Solution:
To sketch this piecewise function, we need to analyze each piece separately:

For x < 0: f(x) = |x|
This is the absolute value function, which forms a V-shape with vertex at the origin, but we only use the left side (negative x-values).

For 0 ≤ x ≤ 2: f(x) = sin(πx/2)
This is a portion of the sine function, scaled so that it completes half a cycle over the interval [0,2].
At x = 0: sin(0) = 0
At x = 1: sin(π/2) = 1
At x = 2: sin(π) = 0

For x > 2: f(x) = 4-x
This is a straight line with slope -1 and y-intercept 4.

To check for discontinuities, we examine the transition points:
At x = 0: 
Left limit: lim(x→0-) |x| = 0
Right limit: lim(x→0+) sin(πx/2) = 0
The function is continuous at x = 0.

At x = 2:
Left limit: lim(x→2-) sin(πx/2) = 0
Right limit: lim(x→2+) (4-x) = 4-2 = 2
The function is discontinuous at x = 2, with a jump discontinuity.

Therefore, the function has a discontinuity at x = 2."

Question: 
For the function f(x) = x³ - 6x² + 9x + 1:
(i) Find the critical points by determining where f'(x) = 0
(ii) Determine the intervals where f(x) is increasing or decreasing
(iii) Identify all local maximum and minimum points","Solution:
(i) To find the critical points, we need to find where f'(x) = 0:
   f(x) = x³ - 6x² + 9x + 1
   f'(x) = 3x² - 12x + 9
   
   Setting f'(x) = 0:
   3x² - 12x + 9 = 0
   3(x² - 4x + 3) = 0
   x² - 4x + 3 = 0
   
   Using the quadratic formula:
   x = (4 ± √(16-12))/2
   x = (4 ± √4)/2
   x = (4 ± 2)/2
   
   So x = 3 or x = 1 are the critical points.

(ii) To determine where f(x) is increasing or decreasing:
   For x < 1: f'(x) > 0, so f(x) is increasing
   For 1 < x < 3: f'(x) < 0, so f(x) is decreasing
   For x > 3: f'(x) > 0, so f(x) is increasing

(iii) Local maximum and minimum points:
   At x = 1: f(1) = 1³ - 6(1)² + 9(1) + 1 = 1 - 6 + 9 + 1 = 5
   This is a local maximum since f(x) changes from increasing to decreasing.
   
   At x = 3: f(3) = 3³ - 6(3)² + 9(3) + 1 = 27 - 54 + 27 + 1 = 1
   This is a local minimum since f(x) changes from decreasing to increasing.
   
   Therefore, the local maximum is at (1,5) and the local minimum is at (3,1)."

Let f(x) = 3x² - 1 and g(x) = √(x+4)
Determine the following compositions and their domains:
(i) (f∘g)(x)  (ii) (g∘f)(x)  (iii) (f∘f)(x)  (iv) (g∘g)(x)","Solution:
(i) (f∘g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(√(x+4)) = 3(√(x+4))² - 1 = 3(x+4) - 1 = 3x + 12 - 1 = 3x + 11
   Domain: For g(x) to be defined, we need x+4 ≥ 0, so x ≥ -4
   Therefore, domain of (f∘g)(x) is x ≥ -4 or [-4,∞)

(ii) (g∘f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(3x² - 1) = √((3x² - 1) + 4) = √(3x² + 3)
   Domain: For g(f(x)) to be defined, we need 3x² - 1 + 4 ≥ 0, so 3x² + 3 ≥ 0
   Since 3x² ≥ 0 for all real x, and 3 > 0, this inequality is always satisfied.
   Therefore, domain of (g∘f)(x) is all real numbers or (-∞,∞)

(iii) (f∘f)(x) = f(f(x)) = f(3x² - 1) = 3(3x² - 1)² - 1 = 3(9x⁴ - 6x² + 1) - 1 = 27x⁴ - 18x² + 3 - 1 = 27x⁴ - 18x² + 2
   Domain: Since f(x) is defined for all real numbers, (f∘f)(x) is also defined for all real numbers.
   Therefore, domain of (f∘f)(x) is (-∞,∞)

(iv) (g∘g)(x) = g(g(x)) = g(√(x+4)) = √(√(x+4) + 4) = √(√(x+4) + 4)
   Domain: For g(x) to be defined, we need x+4 ≥ 0, so x ≥ -4
   For g(g(x)) to be defined, we need g(x) + 4 ≥ 0, so √(x+4) + 4 ≥ 0
   Since √(x+4) ≥ 0 for x ≥ -4, and 4 > 0, this inequality is always satisfied when x ≥ -4.
   Therefore, domain of (g∘g)(x) is x ≥ -4 or [-4,∞)"

(i) (f∘g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x² + 3) = 1/((x² + 3) - 2) = 1/(x² + 1)
   Domain: For f(g(x)) to be defined, we need g(x) ≠ 2, so x² + 3 ≠ 2, which means x² ≠ -1
   Since x² ≥ 0 for all real x, x² can never equal -1.
   Therefore, domain of (f∘g)(x) is all real numbers or (-∞,∞)

(ii) (g∘f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(1/(x-2)) = (1/(x-2))² + 3 = 1/((x-2)²) + 3
   Domain: For f(x) to be defined, we need x ≠ 2
   Therefore, domain of (g∘f)(x) is all real numbers except 2, or (-∞,2)∪(2,∞)

(iii) To find (f∘g)(1):
   g(1) = 1² + 3 = 4
   f(g(1)) = f(4) = 1/(4-2) = 1/2
   Therefore, (f∘g)(1) = 1/2

(iv) To find (g∘f)(0):
   f(0) = 1/(0-2) = 1/(-2) = -1/2
   g(f(0)) = g(-1/2) = (-1/2)² + 3 = 1/4 + 3 = 3.25
