"[Original - Section 6.1] Let f(x) = {1/(x-2), if x > 2; x², if -2 ≤ x ≤ 2; 3, if x < -2}. Evaluate the following: (i) f(-5) (ii) f(-2) (iii) f(0) (iv) f(1) (v) f(2) (vi) f(3).","Solution: We evaluate the function by determining which piece applies for each input value. (i) f(-5): Since -5 < -2, we use the third piece: f(-5) = 3. (ii) f(-2): Since -2 = -2, we use the second piece: f(-2) = (-2)² = 4. (iii) f(0): Since -2 < 0 ≤ 2, we use the second piece: f(0) = 0² = 0. (iv) f(1): Since -2 < 1 ≤ 2, we use the second piece: f(1) = 1² = 1. (v) f(2): Since -2 < 2 ≤ 2, we use the second piece: f(2) = 2² = 4. (vi) f(3): Since 3 > 2, we use the first piece: f(3) = 1/(3-2) = 1/1 = 1."

"[Original - Section 6.1] Find the difference quotient (f(a+h) - f(a))/h if f(x) = 1/x².","Solution: We compute each component and then assemble the difference quotient. f(a+h) = 1/(a+h)². f(a) = 1/a². (f(a+h) - f(a))/h = (1/(a+h)² - 1/a²)/h = (a² - (a+h)²)/(h·a²·(a+h)²) = (a² - a² - 2ah - h²)/(h·a²·(a+h)²) = (-2ah - h²)/(h·a²·(a+h)²) = (-2a - h)/(a²·(a+h)²). As h approaches 0, this approaches -2a/(a²·a²) = -2/a³."
"[Variation] Calculate the difference quotient (f(x+h) - f(x))/h for the function f(x) = 3x² - 2x + 1, and determine what this expression approaches as h approaches 0.","Solution: First, we find f(x+h) and f(x): f(x+h) = 3(x+h)² - 2(x+h) + 1 = 3(x² + 2xh + h²) - 2x - 2h + 1 = 3x² + 6xh + 3h² - 2x - 2h + 1. f(x) = 3x² - 2x + 1. (f(x+h) - f(x))/h = (3x² + 6xh + 3h² - 2x - 2h + 1 - 3x² + 2x - 1)/h = (6xh + 3h² - 2h)/h = 6x + 3h - 2. As h approaches 0, this approaches 6x - 2, which is the derivative f(x)."
"[Original - Section 6.2] Sketch the graph of f(x) = {1, if x ≤ 0; x², if 0 < x < 1; 1/x, if x ≥ 1}.","Solution: We analyze each piece of the function: For x ≤ 0: f(x) = 1, which is a horizontal line at y = 1 for all negative x values. For 0 < x < 1: f(x) = x², which is a portion of a parabola. At x = 0, the limit from the right is 0, creating a discontinuity. For x ≥ 1: f(x) = 1/x, which is a hyperbola. At x = 1, both pieces give f(1) = 1, so the function is continuous at x = 1. The function has a jump discontinuity at x = 0."
"[Variation] Sketch the graph of g(x) = {|x|, if x < 0; sin(πx/2), if 0 ≤ x ≤ 2; 4-x, if x > 2}. Identify any discontinuities.","Solution: Analyzing each piece of the function: For x < 0: g(x) = |x| = -x, which is a line with slope -1 for negative x values. For 0 ≤ x ≤ 2: g(x) = sin(πx/2), which is half a period of the sine function. At x = 0, g(0) = sin(0) = 0, and |0| = 0, so the function is continuous at x = 0. For x > 2: g(x) = 4-x, which is a line with slope -1. At x = 2, g(2) = sin(π) = 0, but 4-2 = 2, creating a discontinuity. The function has a jump discontinuity at x = 2."
"[Original - Section 6.2] Using the graph of f(x), determine the intervals where f is increasing or decreasing. Also, determine any local maximum points or local minimum points.","Solution: From the graph, we can see that f(x) is increasing on the interval (-∞, 0) and decreasing on the interval (0, ∞). The function has a local maximum at x = 0, where the function changes from increasing to decreasing. There are no local minimum points visible on the graph."
"[Variation] For the function f(x) = x³ - 6x² + 9x + 1, find the critical points and determine the intervals where the function is increasing or decreasing. Identify all local maxima and minima.","Solution: To find critical points, we set f(x) = 0: f(x) = 3x² - 12x + 9 = 3(x² - 4x + 3) = 3(x - 1)(x - 3) = 0. So x = 1 or x = 3 are critical points. Testing intervals: For x < 1, f(x) > 0, so f is increasing. For 1 < x < 3, f(x) < 0, so f is decreasing. For x > 3, f(x) > 0, so f is increasing. Therefore, f has a local maximum at x = 1 and a local minimum at x = 3."
